# Arvan-Challange



## Terraform ----> Vsphere

I want to deploy 3 linux machines in Vsphere hosted by my PC with Terraform.
My Terraform server is hosted on 192.168.13.36 linux machine.

1. Go to specific path :
 `cd /opt/IaC-Terraform-ArvanChallange`

2. Initializing a working directory containing Terraform configuration files :
`terraform init`

3.  Creating an execution plan in Terraform :
`terraform plan`

4. Applying changes to my infrastructure :
`terraform apply`

Then we do it for another two workers along that.
We have 3 machines installed on out infrastructure.
